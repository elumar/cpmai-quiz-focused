"Phase II: Data Understanding","Collect Initial Data","Collect Initial Data","A data science team is starting a project to predict customer churn. During Phase I, the project plan identified three potential data sources: CRM history, call center logs, and web clickstream data. In Phase II, the team begins work. Which activity best describes their first hands-on task with the data?","Querying the raw CRM database to confirm record counts and checking if the clickstream data vendor can provide the historical range specified in the project plan.","Merging the CRM, call center, and clickstream data into a single consolidated table and preparing it for model training in a subsequent phase.","Using a histogram to analyze the distribution of call durations in the call center logs and flagging statistical outliers for further investigation.","Writing Python scripts to normalize the date formats across all three data sources so that timestamps are consistent before any analysis begins.","A","The correct answer is A. This describes the core of ""Collect Initial Data""—gathering raw data from identified sources and validating basic availability and access assumptions from Phase I. Option B is incorrect because merging data into a consolidated table is a Data Preparation (Phase III) activity, not an initial collection task. Option C is incorrect because analyzing distributions and flagging outliers is an exploration activity within Phase II, but it occurs after the data has been successfully collected and described. Option D is incorrect because normalizing date formats is a data transformation task that belongs in Phase III: Data Preparation.

"Phase II: Data Understanding","Collect Initial Data","Collect Initial Data","A project plan from Phase I states that a fraud detection model requires transaction data with a minimum of 12 months of history and at least a 5% fraud rate to be feasible. In Phase II, the team accesses the production database. What is the primary purpose of this initial data collection step in relation to the Phase I plan?","To begin training a preliminary model on the available transaction data to see if it can achieve the 5% fraud rate target specified in the project plan.","To validate that data matching the specified volume, history, and class distribution is available and accessible as assumed in the Phase I feasibility assessment.","To clean the transaction data by removing any incomplete or duplicate records before the data science team begins reviewing it for analysis.","To create a final, labeled dataset with fraud and non-fraud tags that is ready to be split into training and test sets for model development.","B","The correct answer is B. Initial data collection is the checkpoint to validate the assumptions made in Phase I about data feasibility—confirming that the data actually exists, is accessible, and meets the specifications. Option A is incorrect; model training occurs much later, in Phase IV: Model Development, and is not part of initial data collection. Option C is incorrect; cleaning and removing records is a Data Preparation (Phase III) task, not a Phase II collection activity. Option D is incorrect; creating the final labeled dataset is the output of multiple tasks in Phase III: Data Preparation, not Phase II.

"Phase II: Data Understanding","Collect Initial Data","Collect Initial Data","During Phase II data collection for a predictive maintenance project, a team discovers that the sensor data they planned to use from the legacy manufacturing line is only stored for 30 days. The Phase I plan required three years of historical data to identify failure patterns. What is the correct immediate action for the team?","Proceed with model development using the 30 days of available data and adjust performance expectations during the model evaluation phase.","Attempt to impute the missing three years of data using statistical interpolation methods during the data preparation phase.","Document the finding and return to Phase I to re-evaluate the project's feasibility and data requirements given this constraint.","Ask the IT team to begin archiving the current sensor data daily so that in three years the project will have sufficient historical data.","C","The correct answer is C. A core tenet of the CPMAI methodology is that Phase II data understanding activities can invalidate Phase I assumptions, triggering an iterative loop back to reassess business objectives and data feasibility. Option A is incorrect because proceeding with grossly insufficient data violates the agreed-upon project plan and would likely produce an unreliable model. Option B is incorrect; imputing three years of sensor data from 30 days of records is not feasible and would introduce severe bias—data collection is about finding real data, not creating it artificially. Option D is incorrect because waiting three years is not a viable solution for the current project timeline and ignores the iterative nature of CPMAI.

"Phase II: Data Understanding","Collect Initial Data","Describe Data","A team has successfully collected customer survey response data for a churn prediction project. Before performing any statistical analysis or creating visualizations, they produce a document listing all 42 survey questions as features, noting that responses range from 1 to 5, identifying that 15% of records have missing age data, and recording that the data spans from January to June 2023. Which Phase II activity does this scenario represent?","Data Exploration, because the team is investigating the characteristics of the dataset to understand patterns and relationships between variables.","Data Preparation, because the team is organizing and structuring the raw data into a usable format before it can be used for modeling.","Data Labeling, because the team is adding annotations and metadata tags to the dataset so the model can learn from categorized examples.","Data Description, because the team is creating an objective, factual profile of the data's features, value ranges, missing values, and time coverage.","D","The correct answer is D. The scenario describes the factual, objective profiling of data—its features, value ranges, missing values, and time coverage—which is the definition of ""Describe Data"" in Phase II. Option A is incorrect because Data Exploration involves analyzing patterns, relationships, and distributions, which is a subsequent investigative step that goes beyond documenting what the data contains. Option B is incorrect because Data Preparation involves acting on the data by selecting, cleaning, and transforming it in Phase III, not simply documenting its current state. Option C is incorrect because Data Labeling is the process of adding target annotations to data for supervised learning, which is a Phase III: Data Preparation task.

"Phase II: Data Understanding","Collect Initial Data","Describe Data","A project manager notices the data science team is excited to immediately start building charts and running correlation analysis on a new dataset. Citing the CPMAI methodology, the project manager advises them to first perform a structured review to document the data's structure, the data types of each feature, and the percentage of null values per column. What is the primary risk of skipping this structured review and proceeding directly to analysis?","The team might create visualizations that are statistically invalid because underlying data type mismatches went undetected before the analysis began.","The team may miss critical data quality issues like mixed data types in a column or unexpected null patterns, leading to inaccurate analytical results later.","The project will be delayed because the visualization tools and analysis platforms require a completed data description report as a mandatory input.","The team will be unable to select a model algorithm in Phase IV because algorithm selection requires the data description document as a formal prerequisite.","B","The correct answer is B. The ""Describe Data"" step is a factual inventory of the dataset. Skipping it means the team might not realize, for example, that a column intended to be numerical is actually stored as text, which would cause errors in subsequent analysis and preparation. Option A is a possible downstream outcome, but the root cause is the undetected data quality issue described in B, making B the more direct and primary risk. Option C is incorrect; tools do not require a human-readable description report as a mandatory input to function. Option D is incorrect; model selection in Phase IV depends on the problem type and the prepared data, not the description document itself.

"Phase II: Data Understanding","Collect Initial Data","Describe Data","A data science team has just received access to a new customer transactions dataset. A junior analyst immediately opens the data in a notebook and begins plotting histograms and calculating correlations between variables. The project manager intervenes and says the team needs to first document the number of records, the data types of each column, the percentage of missing values, and the date range covered. Why is the project manager's directive methodologically correct according to CPMAI?","Because describing the data's basic characteristics is a required step before exploration, ensuring the team knows what they have before investigating patterns and relationships.","Because creating histograms and correlations requires a completed data description document to be uploaded into the analysis tool as a configuration input.","Because the team must return to Phase I and update the project plan with the data characteristics before any Phase II analysis activities can begin.","Because data description and data exploration are the same activity in CPMAI, so performing them out of sequence has no methodological impact.","A","The correct answer is A. In the CPMAI methodology, ""Describe Data"" is a foundational step within Phase II that must precede exploration. Description creates an objective inventory of what the data contains (volume, types, missing values, coverage), while exploration investigates patterns and relationships. The project manager is correct that the team should know what they have before analyzing it. Option B is incorrect; analysis tools do not require a formal description document as an input—the description is for the team’s understanding, not a system dependency. Option C is incorrect; documenting data characteristics is a Phase II activity, not a trigger to return to Phase I. Option D is incorrect; description and exploration are distinct activities in CPMAI—description is factual profiling, while exploration involves statistical analysis and visualization.

After collecting and describing the ticket data, they begin to investigate. They create a bar chart of ticket volumes by category, calculate the average response time per category, and note that the ""Critical"" category appears in only 1% of the tickets. Which two key activities of data exploration are demonstrated here?","Data labeling and data augmentation, because the team is annotating the ticket categories and expanding the dataset with synthetic observations.","Statistical analysis and data visualization, because the team is calculating summary metrics and representing patterns in graphical form.","Model training and hyperparameter tuning, because the team is fitting an algorithm to the ticket data and adjusting its settings for accuracy.","Data cleansing and feature selection, because the team is removing invalid records and choosing the most informative variables for modeling.","B","The correct answer is B. The scenario describes calculating averages (statistical analysis) and creating bar charts (data visualization), which are primary activities in the ""Explore Data"" task of Phase II. Option A is incorrect because data labeling and augmentation are Phase III: Data Preparation tasks, not exploration activities. Option C is incorrect because model training and hyperparameter tuning are Phase IV: Model Development tasks that occur much later in the methodology. Option D is incorrect because data cleansing and feature selection are also Phase III: Data Preparation tasks, not Phase II exploration.

"Phase II: Data Understanding","Collect Initial Data","Explore Data and Cognitive Data Requirements","During Phase I, a project identified the AI pattern for a new application as ""anomaly detection"" to find unusual network traffic. In Phase II, during data exploration, the team plots the traffic volume over time and finds that the data is extremely consistent, with virtually no variance. What is the most significant implication of this exploration finding?","The team should immediately begin training a complex deep learning model, as subtle anomalies require sophisticated algorithms that can detect patterns invisible to basic exploration.","The data is perfectly clean and highly consistent, which means it will require very little preparation work in Phase III and can move quickly to model development.","The team should enrich the dataset by generating synthetic anomaly examples to ensure the detection model has sufficient positive cases to learn patterns from.","The data may lack the signal necessary to support the ""anomaly detection"" cognitive requirement identified in Phase I, potentially invalidating the project's feasibility assumptions.","D","The correct answer is D. Exploration is used to assess if the data can support the cognitive requirements from Phase I. If the data shows no variance, it is unlikely to contain any anomalies, meaning the project's core assumption is challenged. This finding would trigger an iterative loop back to Phase I to reassess feasibility. Option A is incorrect; training a model without any signal to detect anomalies is futile regardless of model complexity. Option B is incorrect; consistency does not mean clean—it means the data is potentially useless for this particular anomaly detection task. Option C is incorrect; while generating synthetic data is a valid advanced technique, the first step according to CPMAI is to reassess the feasibility of the cognitive requirement with stakeholders, not to artificially create the missing signal.

"Phase II: Data Understanding","Collect Initial Data","Explore Data and Cognitive Data Requirements","During exploration of a dataset for a binary classification model, a data scientist discovers that 95% of the records belong to Class A and only 5% to Class B. How does this finding most directly impact the downstream phases of the project?","It is a Phase II finding with no meaningful impact on Phase III or IV, as modern classification models are inherently robust to class imbalances and require no special handling.","It confirms the data is ready for model development without further preparation, since a real-world class imbalance is expected and does not require any intervention.","It triggers a specific data preparation strategy in Phase III, such as oversampling, undersampling, or cost-sensitive learning, to address the class imbalance before model training.","It requires an immediate return to Phase I to redefine the business objectives entirely, because a severe class imbalance means the prediction target is fundamentally unacceptable.","C","The correct answer is C. Discovering a class imbalance is a classic exploration finding that directly informs Phase III: Data Preparation decisions. The team will need to plan for techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or cost-sensitive algorithms, ensuring the model can learn from the minority class. Option A is incorrect; class imbalance significantly impacts model performance and must be explicitly addressed—ignoring it typically produces a model that predicts only the majority class. Option B is incorrect; while the imbalance might reflect real-world proportions, the data cannot simply be declared ""ready"" without a preparation strategy. Option D is incorrect; the business objective of predicting Class B remains valid—the imbalance is a data characteristic to be managed through preparation techniques, not a reason to abandon the business goal.

"Phase II: Data Understanding","Collect Initial Data","Explore Data and Cognitive Data Requirements","A team is performing data exploration in Phase II. They are creating scatter plots to visualize relationships between variables and calculating correlation coefficients. A junior team member suggests that these correlation values could be used to remove highly correlated features now to simplify the dataset. According to the CPMAI methodology, why is this suggestion premature?","Correlation analysis is not a valid or recognized technique for understanding data relationships and should not be used during any Phase II exploration activity.","The team cannot remove any features until after a model has been trained in Phase IV and feature importance scores have been calculated from the modeling results.","Removing features based on correlation is a data transformation activity that belongs in Phase III: Data Preparation, not in Phase II, which is for analysis and investigation only.","The project plan from Phase I must first be formally updated and re-approved by all stakeholders to authorize any feature removal, regardless of which phase it occurs in.","C","The correct answer is C. The key distinction in CPMAI is that Phase II (Explore) is for analysis and investigation—understanding the data—while Phase III (Data Preparation) is for acting on that analysis by transforming the data. Removing features is a transformation action, not an exploration activity. Option A is incorrect; correlation analysis is a valid and commonly used exploration technique in Phase II. Option B is incorrect; feature selection based on correlation is a legitimate preparation step in Phase III and does not require a trained model from Phase IV. Option D is incorrect; while the Phase I project plan defines scope, it does not need formal re-approval for every technical decision—the methodological phase determines when transformation activities are appropriate.
